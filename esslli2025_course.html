  <h1>ESSLLI 2025 course <i>Semantics for first-order modal logics: a modern introduction</i></h1>
  
  <blockquote>
    <b>Lecturers</b> <a href="https://www.hse.ru/en/org/persons/23224842/">Valentin Shehtman</a> and <a href="https://dshkatov.github.io/">Dmitry Shkatov</a>
  <blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <b>Abstract</b> The course in a technical introduction to semantics of
    first-order modal logics aimed at students of philosophy, computer science,
    linguistics, and mathematics.  We shall aim to present the state of the art in
    this area within a comprehensive, unified framework.  The main focus will be on
    the Kripke semantics for first-modal logics, but other, more general, kinds of
    semantics shall be considered as tools for proving incompleteness in the Kripke
    semantics.  The course assumes a solid background in classical first-order logic
    (including the completeness theorem) and propositional monomodal logic
    (including completeness through the canonical model construction).
